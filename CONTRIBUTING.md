## Aim of the project

The aim of Julius is to re-create the exact same logic that the original Caesar 3 uses, with full savegame compatibility, but with some small user interface enhancements, like widescreen support. The same logic also means that any gameplay bugs present in Caesar 3 will also be present in Julius.
It is meant as a drop-in replacement for Caesar 3, with the same look and feel, so there will be no major UI changes.

Later on there may be an 'enhanced' edition with new features, but for now any pull requests which change the game logic or alter the UI in a major way will be declined.
